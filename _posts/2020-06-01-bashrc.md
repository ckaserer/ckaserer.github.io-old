If you work most of the time on the CLI like I do you might want to add a bit of color to your shell. With this customized bashrc you get a bash prompt streched over 2 line so you can easily see the user, host, path and git branch if you are in a git repository at a glance. In addition `ls` and `grep` are colorized if your system supports it. As always you can check out the sourcecode in the associated git repository on github at [https://github.com/ckaserer/bash-bashrc.git](https://github.com/ckaserer/bash-bashrc.git).

## Here is how

First we clone the git repository to your machine via

```
git clone https://github.com/ckaserer/bash-bashrc.git
```

Next we configure your `~/.bashrc` to source the content of the `bashrc` file from the repo. We do that by adding the following line to the end of your `~/.bashrc`.

```
if [ -f /path/to/bash-bashrc/bashrc ]; then . /path/to/bash-bashrc/bashrc; fi
```

What did we do just now?! By adding the line above to your `~/.bashrc`  we source the `/path/to/bash-bashrc/bashrc` file if the file exists on a new bash.

It won't work right away since your `~/.bashrc` is only read when you open a new shell. Either open a new shell by executing 

```
bash
``` 

or source the `/path/to/bash-bashrc/bashrc` file manually in your current shell by executing

```
. /path/to/bash-bashrc/bashrc
```
