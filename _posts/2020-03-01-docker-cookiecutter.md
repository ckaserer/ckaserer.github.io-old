## What is cookiecutter?!

Cookiecutter is a command-line utility that creates projects from **cookiecutters** (project templates), e.g. creating a Python package project from a Python package project template.

### Sidenote 

I maintain a containerized version of all cookiecutter releases starting with `1.7.0` at [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/ckaserer/cookiecutter).
If you want to know more check out the associated repository at [github.com/ckaserer/cookiecutter](https://github.com/ckaserer/cookiecutter) or my blog post [containerized cookiecutter](https://ckaserer.dev/docker/2020/02/15/cookiecutter.html).

## Cookiecutter for Docker Images

The goal of today is to standardize and automate your container image build process. From folder structure, to CICD, to publishing to a container registry, to build notifications via slack with cookiecutter templates.

### Requirements
* cookiecutter or its [containerized cookiecutter](https://ckaserer.dev/docker/2020/02/15/cookiecutter.html) version
* travis
* container registry
* slack

To process the `docker-cookiecutter` template execute  

```
cookiecutter https://github.com/ckaserer/docker-cookiecutter
```

Here a quick look at the resulting target folder structure

```
docker-{{cookiecutter.image_name}}
├── .ci
│   └── test.sh                     <- put your tests here
├── .dockerignore                   <- ignore files when building
├── .github                         <- github issue templates
│   └── ISSUE_TEMPLATE
│       ├── bug_report.md
│       └── feature_request.md
├── .gitignore
├── .travis.yml                     <- slack notifications for our tests
├── CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
├── Dockerfile                      <- what we actually want
├── LICENSE
├── README.md                       <- badges and quickstart info
└── bashrc                          <- bash functions for easy of use
```

Next we need to add our registry credentials to be able to push our images to a container registry and our slack integration for build notifications.
You can find the how to for those steps in the README.md of your processed docker-cookiecutter template or directly via this [link](https://github.com/ckaserer/docker-travis-cli).
